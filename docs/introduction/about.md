Reana Jupyterlab extension is a JupyterLab plugin that implements the basic functionalities of the [REANA](https://reanahub.io/) workflow management system. The plugin allows users to interact with the REANA server from within JupyterLab, providing a seamless experience for users who want to run their workflows on the REANA platform.

This project is being developed as a part of the Virtual Research Environment ([VRE](https://github.com/vre-hub)) initiative, created as a part of the [ESCAPE Collaboration](https://projectescape.eu/). The end goal of the VRE is to develop a Hub which aggregates software and infrastructure to create an end-to-end analysis facility for physicists.

This project is currently in development and is subject to change. We are open to contributions and feedback from the community.
