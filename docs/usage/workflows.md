# Workflows list

The "Workflows" tab displays a list of all the workflows that have been created by the user. The list includes information about the workflow, such as the name the run number and the status. The user can interact with the workflows by clicking on any workflow.

The user can filter the list of workflows by using the search bar at the top of the tab. The search bar allows the user to search for workflows by name. There is also a status filter that allows the user to filter the workflows by their status, and a sort button that allows the user to sort the workflows by date in ascending or descending order.

The user can also refresh the list of workflows by clicking on the refresh button at the top of the tab.

# Workflow details

When the user clicks on a workflow in the list, the "Workflows" tab will display the details of the workflow. The details include more information about the workflow. On top of that, there are four tabs that allow the user to interact with the workflow:

- **Engine logs:** Displays the engine logs of the workflow, which includes information about the execution of the workflow.

- **Job logs:** Displays the job logs and information about each step of the workflow. The user can use the dropdown menu to select the step they want to see the logs for.

- **Workspace:** Displays the workspace of the workflow. The user can browse in the workspace by name. If the users want to download the whole workspace to the virtual environment, they can click on the download button next to the search bar. If they want to download specific files, they can select the files by clicking on them and then click on the download button.

After the download, a notification should appear at the bottom right of the screen with the number of files downloaded, and a new directory with the name and run of the workflow should appear in the root directory of the virtual environment.

- **Specification:** Displays the specification and runtime parameters of the workflow.
