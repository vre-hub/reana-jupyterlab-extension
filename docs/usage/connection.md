To connect to a REANA server, you need to provide the server URL and your access token. The server URL is the URL of the REANA server you want to connect to. The access token is a secret key that allows you to authenticate with the REANA server.

To connect to a REANA server, follow these steps:

1. Open the REANA extension by clicking on the REANA icon in the JupyterLab sidebar.
2. Enter the server URL and access token in the corresponding fields.
3. Click on the "Connect" button to save the settings.

After connecting to the REANA server, a notification will appear in the bottom right corner of the screen indicating that the connection was successful. You can now interact with the REANA server from within JupyterLab.
